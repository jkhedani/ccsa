Create new users by logging in as an admin and going to:

                Sidebar Menu > Users > Add New.

### Permissions

Permission structures conform to WordPress standards and can be manipulated by
simply changing the role of the user by editing that user. (Sidebar Menu > Users) You can also find more specifics here:

### Updating menus & Navigation

Update any of the site's navigation:

                Sidebar Menu > Appearance > Menus

Here there are two menus you'll be able to manage. Social Media and the primary menu in the header. To edit a menu:

1. select a menu from the drop down and click "Select".
2. Add pages, posts or custom links from the left sidebar.
3. Be sure to save your changes.

> Note: Remember that menus have translated languages that also need to be updated when the structure changes.


### Updating footer content

We're using widgets to populate the footer. To edit, navigate to:

                Sidebar Menu > Appearance > Widgets

Look for the "Footer Widget Area" dropdown and select the widget you wish to edit.

> Note: Remember that menus have translation counterparts that need to be updated when content changes.

### Updating sliders

To update sliders, navigate to:

                Sidebar Menu > Soliloquy

To add new images to the slider, drop images into the dotted outline square or select images that you have already uploaded.

In order to edit content, click on the blue "i" above an image that has been added to the slider. Here you can edit alt text but more importantly edit the caption that will be displayed over the image.

In order to rearrange slide order, simply drag and move images to the desired position.

Be sure to update your changes.

> Note: Remember that every slider has a translated counterpart that needs to be updated any time content changes.

### Updating general theme elements

To edit any of the following:

- Site Title
- Logo
- Favicon

Navigate to:

                Sidebar Menu > Appearance > Customize


### Working with translations

Translations for content will be addressed in this document where the content is addressed.

In order to update general theme strings, navigate to:

                Sidebar Menu > WPML > String Translations

General strings include things like Admin menu views, dates (like names of months) or text like "Previous" or "Next" for various UI elements.

> Note: Be sure to to confirm the translation when saving by selecting the "Translation is complete" checkbox.

### Updating content


##### ACF
Some of the content areas use Advanced Custom Fields to populate fields. These fields can be edited but should be done by someone who is comfortable working with ACF.
